Imp Notes:
	Immutable Class: Immutable class means that once an object is created, we cannot change its content. In Java, all the wrapper classes (like Integer, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable. We can create our own immutable class as well.
	Ex.
		public final class Employee{
			final int id;
			final String name;
			Employee(int id, String name){
				this.id = id;
				this.name = name;
			}
			public int getId(){
				return this.id;
			}
			public String getName(){
				return this.name;
			}
			
		}
